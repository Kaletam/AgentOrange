AgentOrange v1.1 For Bukkit

A team AwesomePants plugin by Kaletam.



Got so many leaves, creepers are spawning amongst them and leaping down upon innocent lumberjacks?

Drop AgentOrange on them!

Or, if you're more destructively inclined, drop napalm upon the trees, or just plain set them on fire.



WARNING: "napalm" is lava, and in this version, is naively applied - it will turn every leaf block in the radius into lava.



Usage:
	/agentorange deforest - Remove leaves in a 40x40 cube centered on the player.
	/agentorange napalm - Turns leaves into lava in a 40x40 cube centered on the player.
	/agentorange forestfire - Turns leaves into fire in a 40x40 cube centered on the player.

Permissions:
	Permissions (http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/admn-info-permissions-v2-0-revolutionizing-the-group-system.1403/) is supported.
	
	Permissions are:
		agentorange.deforest
		agentorange.napalm
		agentorange.forestfire
	
	Be particularly careful in giving napalm permission.
